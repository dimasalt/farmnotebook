## Farm Notebook issues and future tasks

---

### Transaction page
- Add pagination


### Vehicle Booklog
- Add pagination to the page


### Feed Calculator Page
- Add option to calculate a complete grain finish for 2 last months from 500lb animal to 700lb without 
    any hay for the last 60 days

- Calculator has an error when calculating total foods required. Right now it will calculate 100 lb for gain which is 3lb per day, but if anything else selected like 1 lb those calculations
    would be wrong. Needs to be fixed.


### Feeds Page
- If even there needs to get/store more information on feeds (things such as mineral components etc...), consider moving feed properties to another
    separate table with structure "name" : "value".



### Reports Page 
- Just display with good search functionlity but without ability to add or modify anything


### Contact Page 
- Add pagination to the contact page.
